# Run Mocha tests on browsers

A simple setup to run tests in your browser

## How to use
* Build using `npm run webpack` (or `watch` while developing)
* Include test files in the `src/tests/index.js`
* Open the `index.html` file in your browser _or_ run `npm run test` (currently with a very limitted report)
